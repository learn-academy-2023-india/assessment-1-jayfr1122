# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: if you don't know the answer try answering a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is the source code that is store locally that manipulates data. Githib is a website designed to store git(source code) in order to more easily tracks changes made to the code and enables collaboration with other developers. Git is the local code, Github stores the code remotely.

Researched answer: We are able to use git locally without Github. We can't use github without git.


2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: An array's index refers to the points of data in the array. An array's value refers to the amount of data that is stored in the array and is counted using the indices.

Researched answer: Index refers to the storage location in the array. Value describes the content of the stored (ie : boolean, number ..)

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: 
Differences : 
- Arrays store strings. Strings don't store arrays.
- Mutators and accessors that work on one don't work on the other.

Similarities :
- Both store data.
- Both can be used to manipulate data.

Researched answer:
Differences:
- Arrays are usually fixed with data that is held. Strings can have varying types of elements in the form of characters.
- Arrays have many algorithms built in and can be created quickly.
- Strings are write only which means that whenevr you create a string a new string is output.
- Strings store a collection of consecutive characters.
- Depending on the lanuage a string cannot be treated as an array.
- Array is a block of memory derived from the object class that has a known length and can not be resized on it own. String is an object and isn;t understood as an object as an array is.

Similarities:
- Depending on the lanuage a string can be treated as an array.


4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?

Researched answer: Abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Higher-order Functions: 
- built in methods thhat take afunction as an argument.
- usually operate on arrays.
- will execute once for every item in the array.
- needs a value, index, array declared

2. Jest:
- a Javascript testing framework.
- created by Facebook.
- used by Twitter, Spotify, and Airbnb.
- consists of : a describe statement, an it statement, at least one expect statment, a matcher.

3. Objects:
- Javascrpit datatype  that has a collection of key:value pairs stored in curly braces.
- Can contain both static information as well as actions in the form of methods.
- the intersection of data and behavior.
- the key is a data type of symbol.
- the value is any valid data type in Javascript.
- methods = functions that belong to an object. keyword that references the object.
